keystone-create

This is a little tool to more seamlessly create users (and tenants) via the openstack keystone client api.
The default keystone shell tool is more than capable, but copying and pasting id hashes can be a bit cumbersome. 

Please note that you'll want to edit config.ini with your keystone admin credentials before using the utility.
